# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Overview
This project analyses customer demographic and financial data to predict the likelihood of credit card default. The aim is to explore patterns in the data, evaluate predictive performance and consider potential fairness and bias implications in credit risk modelling.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn- Scikit-learn

## Key Steps
- Identification of target variable and relevant features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and performance evaluation
- Analysis of potential bias in demographic features

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Default of Credit Card Clients dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

## Ethical Considerations
The dataset contains demographic attributes such as gender and marital status. This project discusses how such features may introduce bias and explores considerations for fairer model development.

## Results
The trained model demonstrates good predictive performance and highlights the importance of balancing accuracy with fairness in real-world financial applications.
